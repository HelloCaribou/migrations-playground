# Welcome to the Caribou playground!

This is a repository for you to play around with the Caribou by creating fake migrations, and collaborate with other
beta-testers to get a migration across the finish line!

### Why should you use this project instead of any other personal project?

If you want to use a personal project then we are more than happy for you to do so. The idea behind this playground is
to create a space where multiple beta-testers can use the same migrations, meaning that the Caribou dashboard will
include contributions from multiple people. If you are using Caribou in your own personal project then it will likely
only contain data by yourself.

Another reason for using this project is that you will be able to see migrations already in progress, with many pull
requests on them and a lot of data. That means that even with little time to spare you can still get a sense of how
Caribou works and provide your feedback, which is of great importance to us.

Happy Caribou-ing - anything you need, we are here to help!
